## I have mentioned all the problems with appropriate solutoion . Kindly go through description . 

**Problem 1 : Implement a group_by_owners function that:


Accepts a dictionary containing the file owner name for each file name.
Returns a dictionary containing a list of file names for each owner name, in any order.

For example, for dictionary {'Input.txt': 'Randy', 'Code.py': 'Stan', 'Output.txt': 'Randy'} the group_by_owners function should return {'Randy': ['Input.txt', 'Output.txt'], 'Stan': ['Code.py']}.



 *Solution in   group_by_owners.py  file . I have used online editor to run this file .

**CODE :
  
  I have mentioned code in separate folder . Kindly visit the path . 





**Problem 2 :  Write a function that checks if a given word is a palindrome. Character case should be ignored.


*Solution in Palindrom.cs file for that i have used my vs_2019 version .



**Approach : 
            
     Palindrome :A Palindrome string is the one that once reversed produces the same result as the original input string.implementation is same as normal alorithimatic apporach in the extra i have mentioned (toLower()) function which helps  in case-sensitive  mode .  
     

*Code:   I have mentioned code in the saparate folder.Kindly have a loook . 
  
      
  


**Problem 3 :  Write a function to parse a log file & extract details of Errors & Warnings recorded into a separate file. 




*Solution in ErrorLogg folder for that also i have used vs_2019 version of my local system .  




**Approach : 

In the form.html(visual) and form.cs(approach)  file  i have taken the one grid view and try to assign file as data source to grid source to grid view which is not avialable so it can generate the error file not found and i can log these error details to the text file . 
 
 In the class Name ExceptionLogging to log the error to the text file and wirte it into it . 
 
 
 *Code : i have mentioned  code impelmentation in saparate folder . Kindly have a look . 


 
      


**Problem 4 :  Write a function that provides a change directory (cd) function for an abstract file system.

Notes:

Root path is '/'.

Path separator is '/'.

Parent directory is addressable as '..'.

Directory names consist only of English alphabet letters (A-Z and a-z).

The function should support both relative and absolute paths.

The function will not be passed any invalid paths.

Do not use built-in path-related functions.
          


*Solution in directory.cs file  for that i have used vs_2019 version of my local system . 



**Approach : 
    
     count parent directory occuance then unset parent based 
     on cd & get current update path then rebuilt new path 
     then combine updated path with targeted cd path.
    
    
*code :  I have mentioned in saparate folder . Kindly have a look . 



                                                  **** end ****
