## I have mentioned all the problems with appropriate solutoion . Kindly go through description . 

*Problem 1 : Implement a group_by_owners function that:

·         Accepts a dictionary containing the file owner name for each file name.

·         Returns a dictionary containing a list of file names for each owner name, in any order.

For example, for dictionary {'Input.txt': 'Randy', 'Code.py': 'Stan', 'Output.txt': 'Randy'} the group_by_owners function should return {'Randy': ['Input.txt', 'Output.txt'], 'Stan': ['Code.py']}.

 *Solution in   group_by_owners.py  file . I have used online editor to run this file . 


*Problem 2 :  Write a function that checks if a given word is a palindrome. Character case should be ignored.

 * Solution in Palindrom.cs file for that i have used my vs_2019 version .


*Problem 3 :  Write a function to parse a log file & extract details of Errors & Warnings recorded into a separate file. 


* Solution in ErrorLogg folder for that also i have used vs_2019 version of my local system .  

* Problem 4 :  Write a function that provides a change directory (cd) function for an abstract file system.
Notes:

Root path is '/'.

Path separator is '/'.

Parent directory is addressable as '..'.

Directory names consist only of English alphabet letters (A-Z and a-z).

The function should support both relative and absolute paths.

The function will not be passed any invalid paths.

Do not use built-in path-related functions.
          


*Solution in directory.cs file  for that i have used vs_2019 version of my local system .
